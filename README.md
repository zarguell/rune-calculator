# Elden Ring Golden Rune Calculator

Elden Ring golden runes are super helpful for quickly leveling your character up, especially when you only need a few more runes to get to the next level.

I got tired of doing the mental math in my head, calculating how many runes I needed, etc. So I made this quick and dirty calculator by asking chatGPT to make it for me.

It is published via Github Pages if you wish to use it as well.
